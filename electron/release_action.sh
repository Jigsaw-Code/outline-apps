yarn do electron/build

# --config.asarUnpack must be kept in sync with:
#  - the destination path for the binaries in build_action.sh
#  - the value returned by process_manager.ts#pathToEmbeddedExe

# In addition to per-user/per-machine, --config.nsis.perMachine=true
# makes the installer require admin permissions, which are required
# to install and configure the TAP device.
