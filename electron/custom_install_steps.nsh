  ; This will get bundled into an issue named "could not install TAP device" with the following
  ; attributes:
  ;  - a single breadcrumb containing the output of add_tap_device.bat
  ;  - Windows version, as a tag named "os" with a value identical in most cases to what the
  ;    JavaScript Sentry client produces, e.g. "Windows 10.0.17134"
  ;  - client version
  ;
  ; Note:
  ;  - Sentry won't accept a breadcrumbs without a timestamp; fortunately, it accepts obviously
  ;    bogus values so we don't have to fetch the real time.
  ;  - Because nsExec::ExecToStack yields "NSIS strings" strings suitable for inclusion in, for
  ;    example, a MessageBox, e.g. "device not found$\ncommand failed", we must convert it to a
  ;    string that Sentry will like *and* can fit on one line, e.g.
  ;    "device not found\ncommand failed"; fortunately, StrFunc.nsh's StrNSISToIO does precisely
  ;    this.
  ;  - RELEASE and SENTRY_DSN are defined in env.nsh which is generated at build time by
  ;    {package,release}_action.sh.
