# Outputs a semantic version for the app, intended for use by the Electron clients.
#
# The script looks in a few places for the version, in this order:
#  - The TRAVIS_TAG environment variable trumps all: if present, the version contained here will be
#    used. It may be a "release" build, e.g. the semantic version for the release tagged
#    "linux-v1.0.0" is 1.0.0, or a pre-release build, e.g. the semantic version for the release
#    tagged "daily-2018-12-01" is "0.0.0-daily-2018-12-01".
#  - As an alternative to TRAVIS_TAG, tags associated with the current git will be searched. This is
#    primarily intended for Windows release builds, which cannot be performed on Travis. For this to
#    work, you must specify the -p switch which helps disambiguate commits with multiple release
#    tags.
#  - If the previous two searches fail, the short-form SHA of the current commit will be appended to
#    the version 0.0.0, e.g. 0.0.0+a78f88.
