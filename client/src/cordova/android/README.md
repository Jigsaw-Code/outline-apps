# Android Development Instructions

This document describes how to develop and debug for Android.

The main entrypoint to Android's Java code is `cordova-plugin-outline/android/java/org/outline/OutlinePlugin.java`

## Building the Android app

> ðŸ’¡ NOTE: To easiest way to get set up for Android on a new environment is to use `tools/build/setup_macos_android.sh` or `tools/build/setup_linux_android.sh`.

Additional requirements for Android:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK) 11](https://jdk.java.net/archive/)
  - Set `JAVA_HOME` environment variable if you are building on Windows
- Latest [Android Sdk Commandline Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line) ([download](https://developer.android.com/studio#command-line-tools-only))
  - Place it at `$HOME/Android/sdk/cmdline-tools/latest`
  - Set `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable
- Android SDK 32 (with build-tools) via commandline `$HOME/Android/sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager "platforms;android-32" "build-tools;32.0.0"`
- [Gradle 7.3+](https://gradle.org/install/)

[Android Studio 2020.3.1+](https://developer.android.com/studio) is not required, but it's helpful if you are developing Android code.

To build for android, run:

```sh
  npm run action cordova/build android
```

We also support passing a `--verbose` option on cordova android:

```sh
  npm run action cordova/build android -- --verbose
```

Make sure to rebuild after modifying platform dependent files!

> ðŸ’¡ NOTE: If this command ever gives you unexpected Cordova errors, try runnning `npm run reset` first.

Cordova will generate a new Android project in the platforms/android directory. Install the built apk by `platforms/android/app/build/outputs/apk/<processor>/debug/app-<processor>-debug.apk` (You will need to find the corresponding `<processor>` architecture if you choose to install the apk on a device).

### Building for Android with Docker

A Docker image with all pre-requisites for Android builds is included. To build:

- Install dependencies with `./tools/build/build.sh npm ci`
- Then build with `./tools/build/build.sh npm run action gulp -- build android`

### To install the APK

- Connect an Android device and enable [USB debugging](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options.html#enable).
- Build the app, with `npm run action cordova/build android`
- From the project root, run: `adb install -r -d platforms/android/app/build/outputs/apk/<processor>/debug/app-<processor>-debug.apk`

### To debug the web app on Android

Run Outline on your phone with [USB debugging enabled](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options.html#enable), then on Chrome:

- Go to [chrome://inspect](chrome://inspect)
- Find Outline
- Click inspect
- Open the Console
- Note that all TypeScript code is browserified in a single cordova_main.js

### To debug Java code

Using Android Studio

- Open existing project â†’ `<root_project_dir>/platforms/android`
- Click on "Android Monitor" at the bottom
- Make sure `org.outline.android.client` is selected from the middle menu (it should not say "no debuggable processes")

## Recommended development flow

Most Android-specific Outline code is in the `src/cordova/android/OutlineAndroidLib` directory, which is a valid Android Studio project. You can modify this code by opening this directory in Android Studio, which offers code completion, automated refactoring, version control integration, etc.

This project represents a library that implements most of the Outline native functionality and does not depend on Cordova. That library is imported by the "app" module that is generated by Cordova. The only native Android code outside of this library is `OutlinePlugin.java`, which integrates with CordovaLib.
