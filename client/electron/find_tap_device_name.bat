:: Queries the registry in order to retrieve the most recently installed TAP network adapter's name.
:: Accepts a single argument, the name of an environment variable to store the adapter's name.
:: Exits with a non-zero exit code on failure.
:: Usage example: find_tap_device_name.bat TAP_NAME

:: Some history:
:: We used to use a Go binary for this to improve the name detection:
:: https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-apps/pull/711
:: It was later replaced by this script "following reports that the Go binaries fail to run on some environments":
:: https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-apps/pull/756
