# Outline Client

![Build and Test](https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-client/actions/workflows/build_and_test_debug.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)

The Outline Client is a cross-platform VPN or proxy client for Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and ChromeOS. The Outline Client is designed for use with the [Outline Server](https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-server) software, but it is fully compatible with any [Shadowsocks](https://shadowsocks.org/) server.

The client's user interface is implemented in [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) 2.0. Platform support is provided by [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) and [Electron](https://electronjs.org/), with additional native components in this repository.

## Requirements for all builds

All builds require [Node](https://nodejs.org/) 16 (lts/gallium), in addition to other per-platform requirements.

> ðŸ’¡ NOTE: if you have `nvm` installed, run `nvm use` to switch to the correct node version!

After cloning this repo, install all node dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

## Building the web app

Outline clients share the same web app across all platforms. This code is located in the src/www directory. If you are making changes to the shared web app and do not need to test platform-specific functionality, you can test in a desktop browser by running:

```sh
npm run action src/www/start
```

The latter command will open a browser instance running the app. Browser platform development will use fake servers to test successful and unsuccessful connections.

The app logic is located in [src/www/app](src/www/app). UI components are located in [src/www/ui_components](src/www/ui_components). If you want to work specifically on an individual UI element, try the storybook!:

```sh
npm run action src/www/storybook
```

## Platform-specific development

Each platform is handled differently:

1. [Developing for Apple **(MacOS and iOS)**](docs/apple_development.md)
2. [Developing for **Android**](docs/android_development.md)
3. [Developing for Electron **(Windows and Linux)**](docs/electron_development.md)

## Localization

[We have several pipelines for managing message localization.](docs/localization.md)

## Error reporting

To enable error reporting through [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) for local builds, run:

```bash
export SENTRY_DSN=[Sentry development API key]
[platform-specific build command]
```

Release builds on CI are configured with a production Sentry API key.
