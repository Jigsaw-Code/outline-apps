# Outline Client

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Jigsaw-Code/outline-client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Jigsaw-Code/outline-client)

The Outline Client is a cross-platform VPN or proxy client for Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and ChromeOS. The Outline Client is designed for use with the [Outline Server](https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-server) software, but it is fully compatible with any [Shadowsocks](https://shadowsocks.org/) server.

The client's user interface is implemented in [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) 2.0. Platform support is provided by [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) and [Electron](https://electronjs.org/), with additional native components in this repository.

## Requirements for all builds

All builds require [Node](https://nodejs.org/) 16, in addition to other per-platform requirements.

> ðŸ’¡ NOTE: if you have `nvm` installed, run `nvm use` to switch to the correct node version!

After cloning this repo, install all node dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

## Building the web app

Outline clients share the same web app across all platforms. This code is located in the src/www directory. If you are making changes to the shared web app and do not need to test platform-specific functionality, you can test in a desktop browser by running:

```sh
npm run action src/www/start
```

The latter command will open a browser instance running the app. Browser platform development will use fake servers to test successful and unsuccessful connections.

The app logic is located in [src/www/app](src/www/app). UI components are located in [src/www/ui_components](src/www/ui_components). If you want to work specifically on an individual UI element, try the storybook!:

```sh
npm run action src/www/storybook
```

## Building the Android app

Additional requirements for Android:

- [Android Studio 2020.3.1+](https://developer.android.com/studio)
  - Optional for building, but useful for development
- [Latest Android Sdk Commandline Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line)
  - Place it at `$HOME/Android/Sdk/cmdline-tools/latest`
- Android SDK 30 (with build-tools) via commandline `$HOME/Android/Sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager "platforms;android-30" "build-tools;30.0.3"`
  - Set up the environment: `export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=$HOME/Android/Sdk` (`ANDROID_HOME` is the [recommendation](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/variables), but Cordova wants `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`)
- [Gradle 7.3+](https://gradle.org/install/)

> ðŸ’¡ NOTE: If you're running linux, you can automatically set up the development environment by running `bash ./tools/build/setup_linux_android.sh`

To build for android, run:

    npm run action gulp build android

To rebuild after modifying platform dependent files, run:

    npx cordova platform rm android && npm run action gulp build android

If this gives you unexpected Cordova errors, run:

    npm run clean && npm ci && npm run action gulp build android

Cordova will generate a new Android project in the platforms/android directory. Install the built apk by `platforms/android/app/build/outputs/apk/<processor>/debug/app-<processor>-debug.apk` (You will need to find the corresponding `<processor>` architecture if you choose to install the apk on a device).

To learn more about developing for Android, see [docs/android-development](docs/android-development.md).

### Building for Android with Docker

A Docker image with all pre-requisites for Android builds is included. To build:

- Install dependencies with `./tools/build/build.sh npm ci`
- Then build with `./tools/build/build.sh npm run action gulp -- build android`

## Apple (macOS and iOS)

Additional requirements for Apple:

- An Apple Developer Account. You will need to be invited to join the "Jigsaw Operations LLC" team
- XCode 13+ ([download](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/))
- XCode command line tools: `xcode-select --install`

To build for macOS (OS X), run:

    npm run action build/cordova osx

To build for iOS, run:

    npm run action build/cordova ios

To open the macOS project on XCode:

    open ./platforms/osx/Outline.xcodeproj

To open the iOS project on XCode:

    open ./platforms/ios/Outline.xcodeproj

To learn more about developing for Apple, see [docs/apple-development](docs/apple-development.md)

## Electron

Unlike the Android and Apple clients, the Windows and Linux clients use the Electron framework, rather than Cordova.

Additional requirements for building on Windows:

- [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/install.html). It provides the "missing Unix pieces" required by build system such as rsync (and many others). Besides the default selected Unix tools such as `bash` and `rsync`, please also make sure to install `git` during Cygwin installation as well. You will need to clone this repository using `git` in Cygwin instead of the native Windows version of git, in order to ensure Unix line endings.

To build the Electron clients, run (it will also package an installer executable into `build/dist`):

```sh
npm run action src/electron/build [windows|linux]
```

To run the Electron clients, run:

```sh
npm run action src/electron/start [windows|linux]
```

### Windows Release

To build the release version of Windows installer, you need the following additional requirements:

- [Java 8+ Runtime](https://www.java.com/en/download/). This is required for the cross-platform Windows executable signing tool [Jsign](https://ebourg.github.io/jsign/). If you don't need to sign the executables, feel free to skip this.

## Error reporting

To enable error reporting through [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) for local builds, run:

```bash
export SENTRY_DSN=[Sentry development API key]
[platform-specific build command]
```

Release builds on CI are configured with a production Sentry API key.

## CI Environment Variables

For your CI to run smoothly, you'll need the following in your ENV:

- `SENTRY_DSN` - [url required](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/dsn-explainer/) to enable sentry integration. Same across all platforms.
- `RELEASES_REPOSITORY` - the username and repository name of the repository you're pushing releases to. In our case, `Jigsaw-Code/outline-releases`
- `RELEASES_DEPLOY_KEY` - an ssh secret key for the matching releases repository public deploy key - [how to set this up](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/managing-deploy-keys#setup-2)
- `ANDROID_KEY_STORE_CONTENTS` - the base64'd contents of your [android keystore.jkr](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore) file
- `ANDROID_KEY_STORE_PASSWORD` - the password required to unlock your android keystore. We assume your key and keystore password are the same.
- `IOS_MATCH_GIT_BASIC_AUTHORIZATION` - the base64'd username and access token necessary to access your fastlane iOS credentials [match repository](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/match/)
- `IOS_MATCH_PASSWORD` - the password needed to open your match repository
