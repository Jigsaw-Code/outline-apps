## Access to the free and open internet!

Outline makes it easy to create a VPN server, giving anyone access to the free and open internet.

We have two core apps

- <img alt="Outline Manager Logo" src="docs/resources/logo_manager.png" title="Outline Manager" width="25"> **Outline Manager** ([`/server_manager`](server_manager)): A graphical user interface for managing Outline servers. It is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

- <img alt="Outline Client Logo" src="docs/resources/logo_client.png" title="Outline Client" width="25"> **Outline Client** ([`/client`](client)): A cross-platform proxy client for Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and Linux. The Outline Client is designed for use with the server deployed with the Outline Manager, but it is also fully compatible with any [Shadowsocks](https://shadowsocks.org/) server.

Go to https://getoutline.org for ready-to-use versions of both.
