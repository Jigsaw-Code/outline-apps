Outline makes it easy for anyone to create a VPN server, allowing you to share access to the free and open internet with those in need. **We have two core applications:**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="Outline Manager Logo" src="docs/resources/logo_manager.png" title="Outline Manager" width="14">&nbsp;&nbsp;**Outline Manager** ([`/server_manager`](server_manager)): A graphical user interface for managing Outline servers. It is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. [You can install the manager here](https://getoutline.org/get-started/#step-1).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="Outline Client Logo" src="docs/resources/logo_client.png" title="Outline Client" width="14">&nbsp;&nbsp;**Outline Client** ([`/client`](client)): A cross-platform proxy client for Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and Linux. The Outline Client is designed for use with the server deployed with the Outline Manager, but it is also fully compatible with any [Shadowsocks](https://shadowsocks.org/) server. [You can install the client here](https://getoutline.org/get-started/#step-3).
