// Typings for cordova-plugin-outline

// This enum doesn't logically belong in this file - ideally, it would live in "regular" code (most
// likely somewhere in model). However, since we need to reference it from a typings file, it must
// be defined in a typings file.
//
// Additionally, because this is a typings file, we must declare a *const* enum - regular enums are
// backed, perhaps surprisingly, by a JavaScript object.
