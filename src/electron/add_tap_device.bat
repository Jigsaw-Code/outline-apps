::  - remove leading/trailing space and blank lines with trim()
::  - store the result in NEW_DEVICE
::  - print NEW_DEVICE, for debugging (though non-Latin characters may appear as ?)
::  - invoke netsh

:: Running all this in one go helps reduce the need to deal with temporary
:: files and the character encoding headaches that follow.

:: Note that we pipe input from /dev/null to prevent Powershell hanging forever
