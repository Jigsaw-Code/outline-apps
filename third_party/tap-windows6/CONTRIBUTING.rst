To avoid merging issues patches should be created with git-format-patch or sent
using git-send-email. The easiest way to add the subject line prefix is to use
this option:

  --subject-prefix='PATCH: tap-windows6'

Patches that do not modify the actual driver code can be sent as GitHub pull 
requests. Try to split large patches into small, atomic pieces to make reviews 
and merging easier.
