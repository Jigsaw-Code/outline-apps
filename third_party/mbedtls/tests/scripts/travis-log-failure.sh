# Purpose
#
# List the server and client logs on failed ssl-opt.sh and compat.sh tests.
# This script is used to make the logs show up in the Travis test results.
#
# Some of the logs can be very long: this means usually a couple of megabytes
# but it can be much more. For example, the client log of test 273 in ssl-opt.sh
# is more than 630 Megabytes long.
