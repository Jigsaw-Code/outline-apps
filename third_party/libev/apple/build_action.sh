  # SDKs for iOS 10 and macOS 10.12. weakly link the function `clock_gettime`. This means that for
  # earlier OS versions that do not not support it, `clock_gettime` is declared at compile time.
  # At runtime, the dynamic linker is not able to find the function, which results in a crash.
  #
  # To fix this issue, set SDKVERSION to compile with SDKs iOS 9 and macOS 10.11.
  #
  # Install the SDKs:
  #  - Download Xcode 7.0 from https://developer.apple.com/download/more
  #  - Mount the dmg; do not install Xcode. Right click its icon and select 'Show Package Contents'.
  #  - cp -R /Volumes/Xcode/XCode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS9.0.sdk
  #    /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/
  #  - cp -R /Volumes/Xcode/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.11.sdk
  #    /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/
  #  - Change `MinimumSDKVersion` to 9.0 in
  #    /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Info.plist
  #  - Change `MinimumSDKVersion` to 10.11 in
