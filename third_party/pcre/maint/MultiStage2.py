# Multistage table builder
# (c) Peter Kankowski, 2008

##############################################################################
# This script was submitted to the PCRE project by Peter Kankowski as part of
# the upgrading of Unicode property support. The new code speeds up property
# matching many times. The script is for the use of PCRE maintainers, to
# generate the pcre_ucd.c file that contains a digested form of the Unicode
# data tables.
#
# The script should be run in the maint subdirectory, using the command
#
# ./MultiStage2.py >../pcre_ucd.c
#
# It requires four Unicode data tables, DerivedGeneralCategory.txt,
# GraphemeBreakProperty.txt, Scripts.txt, and CaseFolding.txt, to be in the
# Unicode.tables subdirectory. The first of these is found in the "extracted"
# subdirectory of the Unicode database (UCD) on the Unicode web site; the
# second is in the "auxiliary" subdirectory; the other two are directly in the
# UCD directory.
#
# Minor modifications made to this script:
#  Added #! line at start
#  Removed tabs
#  Made it work with Python 2.4 by rewriting two statements that needed 2.5
#  Consequent code tidy
#  Adjusted data file names to take from the Unicode.tables directory
#  Adjusted global table names by prefixing _pcre_.
#  Commented out stuff relating to the casefolding table, which isn't used;
#    removed completely in 2012.
#  Corrected size calculation
#  Add #ifndef SUPPORT_UCP to use dummy tables when no UCP support is needed.
#
# Major modifications made to this script:
#  Added code to add a grapheme break property field to records.
#
#  Added code to search for sets of more than two characters that must match
#  each other caselessly. A new table is output containing these sets, and
#  offsets into the table are added to the main output records. This new
#  code scans CaseFolding.txt instead of UnicodeData.txt.
#
# The main tables generated by this script are used by macros defined in
# pcre_internal.h. They look up Unicode character properties using short
# sequences of code that contains no branches, which makes for greater speed.
#
# Conceptually, there is a table of records (of type ucd_record), containing a
# script number, character type, grapheme break type, offset to caseless
# matching set, and offset to the character's other case for every character.
# However, a real table covering all Unicode characters would be far too big.
# It can be efficiently compressed by observing that many characters have the
# same record, and many blocks of characters (taking 128 characters in a block)
# have the same set of records as other blocks. This leads to a 2-stage lookup
# process.
#
# This script constructs four tables. The ucd_caseless_sets table contains
# lists of characters that all match each other caselessly. Each list is
# in order, and is terminated by NOTACHAR (0xffffffff), which is larger than
# any valid character. The first list is empty; this is used for characters
# that are not part of any list.
#
# The ucd_records table contains one instance of every unique record that is
# required. The ucd_stage1 table is indexed by a character's block number, and
# yields what is in effect a "virtual" block number. The ucd_stage2 table is a
# table of "virtual" blocks; each block is indexed by the offset of a character
# within its own block, and the result is the offset of the required record.
#
# Example: lowercase "a" (U+0061) is in block 0
#          lookup 0 in stage1 table yields 0
#          lookup 97 in the first table in stage2 yields 16
#          record 17 is { 33, 5, 11, 0, -32 }
#            33 = ucp_Latin   => Latin script
#             5 = ucp_Ll      => Lower case letter
#            11 = ucp_gbOther => Grapheme break property "Other"
#             0               => not part of a caseless set
#           -32               => Other case is U+0041
#
# Almost all lowercase latin characters resolve to the same record. One or two
# are different because they are part of a multi-character caseless set (for
# example, k, K and the Kelvin symbol are such a set).
#
# Example: hiragana letter A (U+3042) is in block 96 (0x60)
#          lookup 96 in stage1 table yields 88
#          lookup 66 in the 88th table in stage2 yields 467
#          record 470 is { 26, 7, 11, 0, 0 }
#            26 = ucp_Hiragana => Hiragana script
#             7 = ucp_Lo       => Other letter
#            11 = ucp_gbOther  => Grapheme break property "Other"
#             0                => not part of a caseless set
#             0                => No other case
#
# In these examples, no other blocks resolve to the same "virtual" block, as it
# happens, but plenty of other blocks do share "virtual" blocks.
#
# There is a fourth table, maintained by hand, which translates from the
# individual character types such as ucp_Cc to the general types like ucp_C.
#
#  Philip Hazel, 03 July 2008
#
# 01-March-2010:     Updated list of scripts for Unicode 5.2.0
# 30-April-2011:     Updated list of scripts for Unicode 6.0.0
#     July-2012:     Updated list of scripts for Unicode 6.1.0
# 20-August-2012:    Added scan of GraphemeBreakProperty.txt and added a new
#                      field in the record to hold the value. Luckily, the
#                      structure had a hole in it, so the resulting table is
#                      not much bigger than before.
# 18-September-2012: Added code for multiple caseless sets. This uses the
#                      final hole in the structure.
# 30-September-2012: Added RegionalIndicator break property from Unicode 6.2.0
