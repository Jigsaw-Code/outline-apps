# Welcome to the Outline Monorepo!

This document provides a guide for AI agents working with the Outline codebase.

## Repository Structure

The Outline monorepo is organized into three main components:

*   `/client`: Contains the source code for the Outline client applications, available on all major platforms.
*   `/server_manager`: Includes the web-based management console for Outline servers.
*   `/infrastructure`: Houses the build system, deployment scripts, and other infrastructure-related code.

## The `npm run action` Command

The primary entry point for all development tasks in this repository is the `npm run action` command. This command is a wrapper around our custom build system, located in the `/infrastructure` directory. It provides a consistent way to build, test, and run all components of the Outline project.

### Common Actions

*   `npm run action list`: Lists all available actions.
*   `npm run action build`: Builds a specific component (e.g., `npm run action client/electron/build`).
*   `npm run action test`: Runs tests for a specific component (e.g.,`npm run action server_manager/www/test`).
*   `npm run action start`: Starts a development server for a component (e.g., `npm run action client/src/www/start`).

For a full list of actions, run `npm run action list`.

## Common Concepts

*   **Access Keys**: These are the credentials used by Outline clients to connect to an Outline server. They are generated by the Outline Server Manager.
*   **Server Manager**: The web-based application used to create and manage Outline servers.
*   **Outline Client**: The application used by end-users to connect to the internet through an Outline server.
*   **Shadowbox**: The core proxy component of Outline, responsible for handling network traffic.
*   **Electron**: The framework used to build the desktop versions of the Outline Client and Server Manager.
*   **Cordova**: The framework used to build the mobile versions of the Outline Client.
*   **Svelte**: The UI framework used for the web-based components of the Server Manager.
*   **Polymer**: The UI framework used for some of the older web-based components of the client.
*   **OutlineAction**: A custom build script located in the `/infrastructure` directory that defines a specific action that can be run with `npm run action`.
